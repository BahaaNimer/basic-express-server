# basic-express-server
This server is just for make some routes, middleware and test them.

First I bulid my server with `Node` and `Express`.

Then create a route called `/person`.

And pass to it a `middleware` and a `callback function`.

And create a global `middleware` and put it in the top.

Then I create a test file for each file and each route.
